CS-106B
=======

Finishing *CS106B* comes after a long time after i've started it, due to life issues and many other reasons, but it's done now and that's what matters.

*CS106B* is such a great course for introducing programming concepts, starting with recursion and going through understanding the behind scenes stuff and implementing it, really amazing journey and totally worth it.

Can't wait to learn more about algorithms, graphs, and AI and many other great stuff in near future, this's only the begining. 

I've used diffrent versions of the online course, but finally took 1138 version as it's assignments files is compitable with linux perfectly without any further modifications, but i've used 1136 slides and schedule to study, not a big diffrence but i believe they're providing new material each year as the science of computing evolving around us.

[1134] (http://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1134/)

Stanford has shutdown accecssing the new versions of the course, which is sad to be honest, hope they'd undo that in the future.
